Alternative Control Syntaxes
PHP supports an alternative way of writing control structures. As per the alternate syntax, we will replace the initial brace with a colon and the closing brace with a structure ending statement such as endif, endswitch, endfor or endwhile.

For example, if...else becomes the following:

if (expression):
    statement1
    statement2
    …
endif;
Or, the if…elseif…else syntax with the structure ending statement looks as follows:

if (expression1):
    statement1
    statement2
    …
elseif (expression2):
    statement3
    …
else:
    statement4
 …
endif;
The while loop becomes the following:

while (expression):
      statement
endwhile;
The same goes for the for loop:

for (expr1; expr2; expr3):
     statement1
     statement2
      …
endfor;
So, it is up to us which syntax we follow. The alternative syntax is supported for users of the earlier versions of PHP.
